> The Bootstrap CDN
   
    For faster loading time.
    Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. 
    As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. 
    Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, 
    it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time
